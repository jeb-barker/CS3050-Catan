# CS3050-Catan
When running render.py, a screen with the default catan board setup will appear in the middle of the screen.

Note: this project requires the pyglet package to run.

Thanks to Bryant Cabrera (https://github.com/BryantCabrera/Settlers-of-Catan) for creating .jpgs for the resource hexes.
